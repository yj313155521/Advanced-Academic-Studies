	abstract = {This article proposes that the value of information is a topic worth revisiting in the contemporary era. Although the topic has been of perennial interest to information professionals and others, since at the least the early 1980s, we believe that it is timely to revisit this question in the context of a more connected and networked environment of data, information, and knowledge. The principal argument is that existing models of information exchange and use do not sufficiently take account of the multiplicity of networked users as a source of value, for example, their implicit and explicit interactions with other users, and with the information system. We briefly review existing kinds of value that have been theorized, operationalized, and measured in the information science literature. Principally, these are the notions of information as embedded value; and information and information systems as adding value. To these notions we add the further notion of connected or cocreated value. We conclude our opinion article with a set of questions intended to orient future research into the question of the value of information in the contemporary era.},

	title = {The {Value} of {Behavioral} {Targeting}},
	abstract = {This study seeks to provide an initial understanding of the effect of behaviorally targeted advertising on advertising rates and revenues. A survey of twelve ad networks was conducted to obtain quarterly data on pricing (CPM data), conversion rates, and revenues across various types of ad segments (run of network advertising and behavioral advertising). The survey results reveal three key findings: (1) Advertising rates are significantly higher for behaviorally targeted ads. The average CPM for behaviorally targeted advertising is just over twice the average CPM for run-of-network advertising. On average across participating networks, the price of behaviorally targeted advertising in 2009 was 2.68 times the price of run of network advertising. (2) Advertising using behavioral targeting is more successful than standard run of network advertising, creating greater utility for consumers from more relevant advertisements and clear appeal for advertisers from increased ad conversion. (3) Finally, a majority of network advertising revenue is spent acquiring inventory from publishers, making behavioral targeting an important source of revenue for online content and services providers as well as third party ad networks. This study was sponsored by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). The NAI is a coalition of more than 40 leading online marketing companies committed to building consumer awareness and reinforcing responsible business and data management practices and standards. For a description of the NAI and a list of its members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp (last visited Mar. 3, 2010).},

	abstract = {On 10 September 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China updated its legislative agenda and planned to enact a comprehensive data protection law by March 2022. This Plan would end the longstanding speculation among Chinese scholars and foreign observers about the direction of China’s data protection regime. Nevertheless, whether such a law can be enacted on time remains uncertain. This article examines the current challenges to the creation of a workable data protection law in China. The main challenges are related to the hasty implementation of the information and communications technology (ICT) development strategies, the current weak legal framework and the unprepared scholars and lawmakers. This article concludes that the enactment of a data protection law is not an easy task. This task is likely to be delayed, suspended, or proved to be a failure if the aforementioned obstacles are not resolved properly. Finally, to provide meaningful data protection, this article provides four basic policy and legal recommendations: (1) pay more attention to protecting individuals’ personal data against unreasonable use by industry and government; (2) cautiously learn from legislative experience of western countries; (3) explore the best practices under Chinese contexts; and (4) enforce the protection rules in a more meaningful manner.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.17645/mac.v5i2.890},
	abstract = {This article focuses on market-driven collection of personal data and its regulation in China. It argues that there is a growing demand for personal data from China’s advertising, marketing, and credit reporting businesses. Meanwhile, the rapid development of the Internet, notably social media and e-commerce, has generated very large pools of personal data on digital platforms. These two factors contribute to the fast growth of both legitimate and illegitimate collection and exploitation of personal information. Chinese laws and regulations lag behind the market and are not ready to regulate personal data as a key economic resource. They scatter in a wide array of economic and social sectors and lack a coherent structure and effective enforcement mechanism. Unspecified overarching rationale, ambivalent market regulation, inadequate enforcement, as well as safety risks of governmental databases are problems that hinder the protection of personal data in China. The role and implications of the new Internet Security Law, entering into force in June 2017, remain to be seen.},

With the EU’s implementation of a new data protection regulation in 2018, the development of personal data protection globally has reached an important turning point and has sparked the interest of scholars and businesses. Text coding was employed to compare the current personal data protection regulation landscape in the EU and in China to discover the differences between the General Data Protection Regulation and the personal data protection regulations of the fastest-growing economy in e-commerce. The results show that while there are several similarities in regard to general requirements, such as principles of data processing and basic rights for data subjects, China’s personal data protection regulations tend to lack specific operational requirements and strong legal enforcement. Based on the research results, implications and recommendations for the government and companies are provided.},
